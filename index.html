                    Hi I'm James, your instructor, and the creator of Early Career Mastery. 
                </p>
                <p>I started this free course to provide answers to some of the most common questions and problems that young professionals
                face early in their career. Since graduating college in 2020, I've made multiple career shifts, gained valuable mentors, developed many new skills,
                and figured out the type of work that fulfills and inspires me.</p>
                <p>Today, I'm in the dynamic, challenging, and exciting role of an Associate Product Manager at a growth-stage startup.</p>
                <p>Through my experiences, I've learned strategies that have helped me:</p>
                <ul id="experience-copy">
                    <li>Rapidly acquire new, valuable skills</li>
                    <li>Tap into the knowledge of experienced mentors</li>
                    <li>Develop the soft skills necessary to lead teams, align stakeholders, and foster positive relationships with co-workers and
                    customers</li>
                    <li>Stay organized and boost my productivity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And much more.</p>
                <p>Chances are that if you found this course, it's because at least one of the following things are true:</p>
                <ul id="experience-copy">
                    <li>You just graduated college and don't know what you want to do</li>
                    <li>You're looking for your first job, but have had trouble getting interviews, or getting through the interview process</li>
                    <li>You want to make a career switch, but aren't sure how to go about it</li>
                    <li>You're having trouble navigating difficult relationships with co-workers, customers, or your boss</li>
                    <li>You feel unfulfilled in your work and want to find a career you're more passionate about</li>
                    <li>You want to move up quickly, gain new skills, and make more money</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you find yourself in any of the situations listed above, <strong>this course is for you.</strong></p>
                <p>And if you didn't come here for one of those reasons, don't worry. This course is loaded with useful career advice, as well as tools and framework that anyone can use to improve their
                career.</p>
